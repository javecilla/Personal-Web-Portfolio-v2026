# CineMatch: Real-time Collaborative Movie Discovery Engine

This project is a high-fidelity mobile application developed for the **IT 308W | MOBILE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 2** course at Bulacan State University.

---

## About the App

**CineMatch** is an enterprise-grade collaborative engine designed to eliminate decision paralysis for movie nights. Using a real-time swiping ecosystem, users can sync with friends to find the perfect film.

The application leverages the **TMDB (The Movie Database) API** for a massive content catalog and **Firebase Realtime Database** to maintain low-latency synchronization between lobby members.

### How It Works

The app utilizes a frictionless **Swipe-to-Match** mechanic designed for modern user retention. You aren't just picking a movie; you are syncing interests in real-time.

- **The Lobby Ecosystem:** A host creates a room, generating a unique `Room Code`. Members join the session in real-time, creating a shared execution context.
- **The Swiping Logic:** To survive the night, you must swipe through trending movies. "Yes" swipes are recorded in the cloud, while "No" swipes are discarded.
- **The Match:** Once every member in the lobby selects "Yes" for the same title, a "Match Found" event triggers, securing the deployment of your movie night.

### Key Features

- **Movie Discovery:**
  - Dynamic display of movie lists fetched from TMDB.
  - Search functionality to find movies by title.
  - Interactive carousels showcasing trending and top-rated movies.
- **User Personalization:**
  - Secure user registration and login powered by Firebase Authentication.
  - Ability to save movies to a personal Favorites list.
  - Capability to add movies to a Watchlist for future viewing.
- **Collaborative Swiping (The CineMatch Engine):**
  - Real-time lobby ecosystem where users can host or join movie-matching sessions.
  - Sub-second, low-latency synchronization of active lobby members using Firebase Realtime Database.
  - Frictionless "Swipe-to-Match" voting mechanic to collectively decide on the perfect film.
